change or store the sample in the sample.txt;
then run the code;
but it may read one paragraph text,but our code cannot adjust the length of the generated text.
run again;
the result show the backward word is choosen randomly after the forward word;
basically, after the program scan all sample text. 
for example, the program wil remember the words have appeared after" the", 
then it will generate the text by choosing a word randomly from the words remembered in the forward step,
then we can get the diffierent results, just like in the class.
